"""SHADOW_HOUSE_BETA.PY (VERSION 3, BETA 01)

A short text game.

The game requires Python 3.6 or 3.7 to run. Other lower 'three' have not
been tested. It will not work on Python 2.7.x without some gerry-mandering to
the code.

You can feed the game file directly to the interpreter as so.

    $ python3 shadow_house_beta.py

Alternatively, you can run the bash script "shadow_house." It's not really
different except the font is bold white on a black background and everything
on your console is 'cleared' when the game is launched. I recommend making the
bash file into an executable first.

    $ chmod +x shadow_house     #make into executable
    $ ./shadow_house            #run game
